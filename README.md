# Energy Consumption Prediction in the Steel Industry – South Korea

# Objective:
To identify the most suitable machine learning model for predicting energy consumption in South Korea's steel industry, with the goal of supporting eco-friendly and energy-efficient production strategies.

# Project Description:
Collected and processed industry-specific energy consumption data. Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover trends, detect outliers, and understand the distribution of features. Feature selection was carried out based on statistical significance (p-values) and multicollinearity checks using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to improve model robustness.

Developed and evaluated several machine learning models including:

Multiple Linear Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Bagging and Boosting (e.g., Gradient Boosting)

These models were implemented using scikit-learn and tested under different train-test split ratios (70:30, 80:20) to validate performance. Key evaluation metrics included:

Accuracy

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

# Conclusion:
The Random Forest model outperformed other algorithms with the highest accuracy of 98%, and strong R² and low RMSE values, making it the most reliable choice for predicting energy consumption. This model provides actionable insights that can help the steel industry transition toward more sustainable energy practices.
